    "article_text": "Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday defended his government’s decision to instruct the national cricket team to boycott their T20 World Cup group match against India, calling it an “appropriate decision” taken after careful consideration.\nThe move follows Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament after they refused to play matches in India citing “security concerns,” with Scotland drafted in as their replacement.\nAs a show of solidarity, the Pakistan government directed its team to skip the February 15 fixture in Colombo.\nAddressing the issue after a government meeting, Sharif said, “We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won't play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field.” Emphasising support for Bangladesh, he added, “We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh.”\nIf this was forwarded to you, subscribe for direct delivery and discover more newsletters."
